## Problem Definition and Solution

Our Client Mr Eric Rebeiro who is an experienced hairdresser seeks to create a website with more functionality for it to market his hairstyling business. He currently has a simple app created using wix however he finds that the website is very rigid and not as customisable. 

Problems

The client would want functionalities which are:
- more robust booking system with appointment reminders and a contact us messaging system. 
- he wants to be able to make bookings with limited information(name and phone number)
- client does not have any marketing component on his website or analytics features.

Solutions

We will create a website that focuses on the ease of making appointments based on the service which they have chosen. Logging in as an admin, the client is able to make bookings for client with just minimal information(name and phone number).
